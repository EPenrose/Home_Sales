# Home_Sales
Utilizing SparkSQL for the analysis of home sales data, I will employ Spark to perform various operations, including creating temporary views, partitioning the data, caching and uncaching temporary tables. Additionally, I will validate the successful uncaching of the table.

This project aims to address the following inquiries:

What is the mean price of four-bedroom houses sold each year? The answer will be rounded to two decimal places.

What is the mean price of homes for each year of construction with three bedrooms and three bathrooms? The response will be rounded to two decimal places.

What is the mean price of homes for each year with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and a minimum of 2,000 square feet? The response will be rounded to two decimal places.

What is the "view" rating for homes valued at $350,000 or more? I will also determine the query's execution time, rounded to two decimal places.
